    "## Mudcard\n",
    "- **The muddiest part for me was classifying different problems (regression, binary, etc). It isn't always clear which approach is best.**\n",
    "- **I struggled with the classification of which type of target variable to use in different situations**\n",
    "    - Yes, that's a pretty tough question and there is no \"one answer fits all\" solution generally because a problem can be phrased as various different supervised ML problems.\n",
    "    - Always consider what you plan to do with the ML model once it is deployed and figure out what sort of supervised ML problem best suits your needs.\n",
    "- **I'm still a bit confused about the ML pipeline.**\n",
    "- **I think the ML pipeline was the most muddiest just out out familiarity**\n",
    "    - We will go through each step in detail so don't worry about it.\n",
    "- **What to choose for the project? What are the stuffs I need to consider for it.**\n",
    "    - I'll send out an announcement about this in a few days.\n",
    "- **For coding, this course use Python, but my undergraduate courses all used R.**\n",
    "    - We start slow so you could use the first few weeks of the term to pick up python.\n",
    "    - If that's not something you'd like to do, consider dropping the course.\n",
    "- **So for the final project, is it possible to show/give us an example of what is expected for us to show?**\n",
    "    - Yes, there is a final reports folder in the course repo which contains a couple of great final reports from previous years.\n",
    "- **I was struggling a bit with the feature matrix and understanding the difference between that and target variables.**\n",
    "    - The target variable is always the variable you want to predict with the ML model. All other variables are usually in the feature matrix.\n",
    "    - There are some exceptions to it like unique IDs or group IDs, we will cover those later.\n",
    "- **About the target variable concept, i believe including more example will be better for us to understand**\n",
    "    - I'd consider it a responsible use of GenAI to ask it for more examples of each type of supervised ML problem. "

    "<span style=\"background-color: #FFFF00\">**0. Data collection/manipulation**: you might have multiple data sources and/or you might have more data than you need</span>\n",
    "   - you need to be able to read in datasets from various sources (like csv, excel, SQL, parquet, etc)\n",
    "   - you need to be able to filter the columns/rows you need for your ML model\n",
    "   - you need to be able to combine the datasets into one dataframe \n",

    "**1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: you need to understand your data and verify that it doesn't contain errors\n",
    "   - do as much EDA as you can!\n",
    "    \n",
    "**2. Split the data into different sets**: most often the sets are train, validation, and test (or holdout)\n",
    "   - practitioners often make errors in this step!\n",
    "   - you can split the data randomly, based on groups, based on time, or any other non-standard way if necessary to answer your ML question\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Preprocess the data**: ML models only work if X and Y are numbers! Some ML models additionally require each feature to have 0 mean and 1 standard deviation (standardized features)\n",
    "   - often the original features you get contain strings (for example a gender feature would contain 'male', 'female', 'non-binary', 'unknown') which needs to be transformed into numbers\n",
    "   - often the features are not standardized (e.g., age is between 0 and 100) but it needs to be standardized\n",
    "    \n",
    "**4. Choose an evaluation metric**: depends on the priorities of the stakeholders\n",
    "   - often requires quite a bit of thinking and ethical considerations\n",
    "     \n",
    "**5. Choose one or more ML techniques**: it is highly recommended that you try multiple models\n",
    "   - start with simple models like linear or logistic regression\n",
    "   - try also more complex models like nearest neighbors, support vector machines, random forest, etc.\n",
    "    \n",
    "**6. Tune the hyperparameters of your ML models (aka cross-validation or hyperparameter tuning)**\n",
    "   - ML techniques have hyperparameters that you need to optimize to achieve best performance\n",
    "   - for each ML model, decide which parameters to tune and what values to try\n",
    "   - loop through each parameter combination\n",
    "       - train one model for each parameter combination\n",
    "       - evaluate how well the model performs on the validation set\n",
    "   - take the parameter combo that gives the best validation score\n",
    "   - evaluate that model on the test set to report how well the model is expected to perform on previously unseen data\n",
    "    \n",
    "**7. Interpret your model**: black boxes are often not useful\n",
    "   - check if your model uses features that make sense (excellent tool for debugging)\n",
    "   - often model predictions are not enough, you need to be able to explain how the model arrived to a particular prediction (e.g., in health care)"
